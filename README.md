# Project: Melanoma Cancer classification

### Introduction

This project is framed inside the subject Project III: Data Analysis of the Data Science Degree at the [Universitat Politècnica de València](https://www.upv.es/). The topic of the project is the melanoma cancer.

### Abstract

The diagnosis and classification of skin lesions due to skin cancer can be a challenging task for experienced dermatologists. Malignant melanoma is one of the most severe and deadliest forms of skin cancer, whose early detection is crucial to give the appropriate treatment to patients and increase their chances of survival. However, Machine Learning has evolved in such a way that algorithms can detect the features that best describe melanoma and make it possible to establish different patient-based profiles according to clinical records.

We will use data from melanoma confirmed patients to figure out which characteristics of the person or the illness are the consequence of suffering an specific type of melanoma. We have performed clustering analysis to see data grouping tendency and its relation with the original etiopathogenic groups. Then a PLS-DA has been implemented to figure out which features are determining the suffering of a particular melanoma type. After knowing which class of skin cancer is going through a patient, we have analysed the probabilities of survival of the individual.

Our findings might indicate that some specific classes of melanoma are determined by certain characteristics of the person or the cancer. The life expectancy of a patient might be also affected by particular qualities on both factors.
